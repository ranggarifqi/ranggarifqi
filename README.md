## 🚀 Fun Fact 'bout Me

I familiarized myself on **Singlish** by watching one of my boss' [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@singaporeanboy6072).

Thanks Eugene for your videos 🤣.

## 💬 Word of Wisdom 

I believe that, **"Language"** is an important skill that you can use to get new **knowledge** & **opportunities**.

I remember the first time i decided to work overseas.
It was a bit reckless, cos my English was trash & i rarely talks using it. But i can moderately understand when someone speaks in it. So i was yolo-ing at that time.

Turns but it was one of the best decision that i had in my life.
Now i learned that if you want to be more comfortable in a language, learn the basic, improve your listening skill, then just **throw yourself into the jungle** to improve your speaking. Don't worry about grammars & accent.

As long as you can understand what people say, and they can understand what you said, it's all good.

## 👋 Last but not least

I hope you can find anything useful in my github account.

مع السلامة 😉
